# UK101

Repository with BASIC programs that work on the Compukit UK101. 

They've (mostly) been tested using an implementation of <a href="http://searle.x10host.com/uk101FPGA/index.html">Grant Searle's FPGA UK101</a> using the CEGMON monitor and 40K RAM expansion.

1. Primes.bas - Program 6 from the UK101 Manual. Simple prime number generator.

2. Primes2.bas - A faster algorithm for generating prime numbers.

3. Sunrise-sunset.bas - Program to calculate sunrise and sunset times for any given latitude / longitude. From Sky & Telescope, August 1994.

4. Acey-Ducey (Acey- Deucy).bas - Bizarre card game, probably bug-ridden, taken directly from the Compukit UK101 Manual - program 7.
